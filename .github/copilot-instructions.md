This project is a full stack TypeScript web app with a Vite/React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. The app generates and displays dummy data for DORA and SPACE metrics, allows users to select which metrics to generate, and provides options to download the data as CSV or JSON. The app should be runnable locally.
